<h1>Hi, I'm Dan! </h1>

<h2> About me:</h2>

I am a senior Cybersecurity major with a minor in Computer Science. I am passionate about threat hunting, incident response, and digital forensics. I am currently building Security Analytical skills through projects, labs, and certifications. I update my Github as fast as I can complete projects and obtain certifications. I am seeking experience and knowledge in the field.
